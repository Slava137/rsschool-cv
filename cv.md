### Briefly about me:
*Hi, I previously worked as an NDT Engineer. I have been interested in the IT profession for a long time. From all areas, I chose the profession of a Frontend Developer. My main goal is to find a job, that I like and in which I can develop. I am ready to learn new skills that will help me in my new job. Working as an engineer, I mastered some skills of communicating with different people and working in a team. I also learned how to work with various documentation and constantly study to improve my professional skills. I am a responsible and purposeful person who likes to achieve tasks and learn something new!*

### Code example:
**KATA from CODEWARS:**
Task is to write a function that takes two or more objects and returns a new object which combines all the input objects.  
All input object properties will have only numeric values. Objects are combined together so that the values of matching keys are added together.
```javascript
function combine() {
  console.log(arguments);
  let res = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    for (let key in arguments[i]) {
      if (key in res) {
        res[key] = res[key] + arguments[i][key];
      } else {
        res[key] = arguments[i][key];
      };
    };
  }; 
  return res;
}
